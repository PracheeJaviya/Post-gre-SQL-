# Post-gre-SQL-
Quick reference to syntax for functions and procedures in Postgresql. Still working on it.

### To run:
---

 1) Open psql shell and open your database.
 2) Use command : \i ' #path to your program# ' to run the file.
 3) The shell will display : Create function when the code is compiled sucessfully.
 4) To call the function, write `SELECT #function_name(#parameters);`
 5) The output will be displayed in the shell itself.
 
 If you're using windows, change all backward slashes to forward slashes in the path.
 
 eg : the path should look like :-  \i 'C:/Users/prach/Documents/COLLEGE/SEM-4/DBMS/Post-gre-SQL-/Q3.sql'
